# Youtube-Music-Downloader
This is a script I made for my personal use and family but felt others may find it helpful. credit (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)


_____CONTENTS OF README.TXT_____

To use the downloader, simply put your name and playlist link into the Playlists.txt file with a space
between the two. You may put up to 5 users into the Playlists.txt file, an example is as follows:

Andrew MyLink.music/mymusiclinkgoeshere

Amanda MyLink.music/mymusiclinkgoeshere

Erik MyLink.music/mymusiclinkgoeshere

Emily MyLink.music/mymusiclinkgoeshere

Tiffany MyLink.music/mymusiclinkgoeshere

If the file is empty, the script will tell you. If the file is deleted, it will make a new one for you.
Feel free to download the example that is provided in the Playlists.txt ;)

All music will be downloaded from any given link, and will be put into a folder with the selected person's name.
Youtube-dl requires "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package (x86)", if it is not
already installed, the downloader will install it for you.

Upon first run, this README will be moved to \Resources if you ever need to view it later.

I initially made this script for myself and family but feel that others may find it useful as well, i am by no
means a professional and just did this on my free time so if you have any complaints, please file them in your
nearest trash receptical and have a great day...
